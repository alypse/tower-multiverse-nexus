# Tower Idle Toolkit

A collection of constants and utility functions for The Tower - Idle Tower Defense, to build apps, min/max, and analyze the game.

As the constants have to follow the game's versioning, the versioning for this package will likewise match the game versioning, with an extra digit for iteration within a patch.
